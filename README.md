# Shape

> *Tap any theorem in your textbook. Get an interactive visualization and a voice explanation in your native language.*

An AI-native interactive textbook built at HackPrinceton 2026. The student opens a digital page (built-in or imported PDF), taps a formal definition, and a popup unfolds with a Manim animation, native-language narration, and a chat that can answer follow-ups. Everything — UI labels, theorem prose, formal definitions, chat replies, narration — translates into one of seven languages on a single click.

> **⚠️ Note: this repository will not run on machines that have not been pre-configured for Shape at this time.** It depends on a specific local toolchain (Manim CE + MiKTeX + uv-managed venvs, FFmpeg via `imageio-ffmpeg`, an Anthropic + Azure Speech key, and a hand-built `manim_scenes/.venv`) plus pre-rendered MP4s and a translation bundle that aren't checked into git. Treat this as a hackathon submission and demo artifact — not a turnkey installable.

## What it does

- **A textbook viewer** with three built-in books and unlimited PDF imports:
  - **Calculus** — 12 theorems across limits, derivatives, complex numbers, double integration, linear algebra, multivariable optimization, probability theory.
  - **Geometry (Middle School)** — 6 theorems on triangles and circles.
  - **Algebra (Middle School)** — 5 theorems on identities, equations, linear functions.
- **Tappable simpler-explanation boxes**. Each section shows a formal printed-textbook-style definition, then a tappable "simpler explanation" box. Tapping opens a side panel with the relevant Manim animation, a chat for follow-ups, and a transcript.
- **PDF import**. Upload any PDF; the backend extracts text via PyMuPDF, sends it to Claude with a strict JSON schema, and the result is rendered through the same chapters/sections/theorems pipeline as the built-in books. Imported sections matching certain titles (Trapezium Rule, Simpson's Rule, Improper Integrals Type I/II, Comparison Test) automatically get one of the pre-rendered Manim helper videos attached.
- **A library** sidebar (invisible left-edge hover trigger → full-height side panel) listing every textbook in your library, sorted most-recently-opened, deletable.
- **A "✨ Generate visualization" gate** that holds for ten seconds with rotating math quotes before revealing each pre-rendered animation — sells the demo.
- **Audio-led playback**. Video pauses on its last frame to wait for the narration to finish; video stops the moment the audio ends. Narration in 7 languages via Azure Neural TTS.
- **Global chat** at the bottom of the page — draggable, double-click to reset position. Asks Claude with the textbook catalog as context; replies come back with step-by-step solutions, suggested theorem links, and (for matching topics) an embedded Manim video.
- **Single language filter** — every English string in the source flows through `useT()`. Pre-translated bundle ships with the build for instant switching; misses fall back to a runtime `/api/translate` call. Math expressions are masked from translation so LaTeX stays intact.
- **Translation scope** picker — translate the *full page* or just the *popup* that opens when a theorem is tapped.
- **Theme**, **font**, **language**, and **scope** are all switchable from the top nav and persist across reloads.

## Tech stack

### What's actually doing the work in the running demo

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite 5, Tailwind CSS, react-katex, Three.js |
| Backend | FastAPI 0.115 + Uvicorn, Pydantic v2, PyMuPDF |
| LLM | **Anthropic Claude (Sonnet 4.6)** — handles the translation, PDF structuring, /ask chat, and the fallback for /explain |
| TTS | **Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Speech** — neural voices for all 7 languages |
| Animation | **Manim Community 0.20.1** — pre-rendered to MP4 at 1080p60 by `scripts/build_cache.py` |
| LaTeX | MiKTeX (auto-discovered on Windows) |
| FFmpeg | `imageio-ffmpeg` shipped binary |

### Wired for routing but not carrying demo traffic

- **K2-Think v2** (MBZUAI/IFM/Cerebras) — first hop in the English `/explain` cascade, falls through to Mercury → Claude on any error.
- **Mercury** (Inception Labs) — diffusion LLM, sits between K2 and Claude for English.
- **Nile-Chat-12B** (MBZUAI-Paris) — slot for native Egyptian Arabic; in practice `/explain` for `ar` falls through to Claude in this demo.
- **Sherkala-8B-Chat** (MBZUAI/Inception/Cerebras) — slot reserved for native Kazakh; not yet integrated as a client.

The MBZUAI / IFM models are deliberately wired into the `/explain` routing graph as part of the original PRD vision (native-language tutoring for Kazakh and Egyptian Arabic students), but the demo is being carried end-to-end by **Claude + Azure**.

## Languages supported

Each language has: a native script label in the picker, a BCP-47 tag, an Azure neural voice for narration, and pre-translated UI strings bundled at build time. Math notation stays in LaTeX in every language.

| Code | Name | Azure voice |
|---|---|---|
| `en` | English | en-US-AndrewNeural (chat-style) |
| `ar` | Egyptian Arabic | ar-EG-ShakirNeural |
| `hi` | Hindi | hi-IN-MadhurNeural |
| `zh` | Simplified Chinese | zh-CN-YunxiNeural |
| `fr` | French | fr-FR-HenriNeural |
| `kk` | Kazakh | kk-KZ-DauletNeural |
| `ja` | Japanese | ja-JP-KeitaNeural |

Translation has two layers: a **build-time JSON bundle** that the frontend hydrates on load (instant switches for known strings), and a **runtime fallback** through `/api/translate` for strings that weren't pre-bundled (e.g. text from a freshly-imported PDF).

Math is preserved across translation by masking `$...$` and `$$...$$` blocks to opaque `<m0/>`-style XML sentinels before sending the prose to Claude, then splicing the original LaTeX back in afterwards. A permissive restorer handles the corruptions Claude is known to introduce (`[m0]`, `**<m0/>**`, `【m0】`, etc).

## Demo controls (top nav)

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| Logo | Pinned to top-left |
| 📄 Import PDF | Upload a PDF; new book added to the library |
| Font (Sans Serif / Serif) | Switches every visible string between Manrope and Crimson Pro |
| Language (EN / عربي / हिंदी / 中文 / FR / Қазақ / 日本語) | Reload the page in the chosen language |
| Translation scope (Full page / Popup only) | Translate everything, or just the panel that opens on tap |

## Credits

Built at HackPrinceton 2026 (Education track) using Manim Community, Anthropic Claude, Microsoft Azure Speech, KaTeX, React, Tailwind, Three.js, FastAPI, PyMuPDF, Vite, edge-tts.

The **MBZUAI Institute of Foundation Models** sponsor angle (Sherkala for Kazakh, Nile-Chat for Egyptian Arabic, K2-Think for general English) is reflected in the routing scaffolding in `backend/clients/` and the language picker, but the running demo is carried end-to-end by **Claude + Azure**.
